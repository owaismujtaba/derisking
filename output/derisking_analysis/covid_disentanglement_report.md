# COVID-19 Disentanglement Analysis

## Objective

Separate the 'COVID Effect' from the 'Policy Effect' by excluding pandemic-sensitive HS codes.

## Pandemic-Sensitive Sectors Excluded

- **HS 22**: Beverages, spirits, vinegar (alcohol for sanitizers)
- **HS 28**: Inorganic chemicals; gases (medical oxygen)
- **HS 29**: Organic chemicals (disinfectants/drugs)
- **HS 30**: Pharmaceutical products (vaccines, medicines)
- **HS 34**: Soap, cleaning, polishing preparations (sanitizers)
- **HS 38**: Miscellaneous chemical products (disinfectants)
- **HS 39**: Plastics and articles thereof (PPE components)
- **HS 40**: Rubber and articles thereof (medical gloves)
- **HS 62**: Articles of apparel, not knitted (medical gowns)
- **HS 63**: Other made-up textile articles (face masks)
- **HS 65**: Headgear and parts thereof (protective caps)
- **HS 90**: Optical, medical, surgical instruments

## Results

### Period Comparison

| Period | TDI (with pandemic) | TDI (without pandemic) | Pandemic Effect |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Baseline | 15.47% | 14.71% | 0.76% |
| Intervention | 21.86% | 20.94% | 0.92% |

### Trend Analysis (Excluding Pandemic Goods)

- **Pre-2020 slope**: +0.5016%/year
- **Post-2020 slope**: +1.0483%/year
- **Acceleration**: +0.5467%/year

## Conclusion

✅ **The upward trend in TDI PERSISTS even after excluding pandemic-sensitive goods.**

This suggests that the increase in China dependency is NOT solely due to COVID-19 demand spikes,
but reflects a broader structural trend that the derisking policy failed to reverse.
