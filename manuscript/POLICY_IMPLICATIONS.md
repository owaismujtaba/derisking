# Policy Implications: Why Derisking Failed and What to Do Next

## 5. Policy Implications

### 5.1 Understanding the Failure

Our analysis reveals that India's derisking initiative not only failed to reduce dependency on China but actually **accelerated** it. The Trade Dependency Index increased from 15.47% (baseline) to 21.86% (intervention), with the post-2020 trend (+0.90%/year) significantly faster than the pre-2020 trend (+0.53%/year). This counterintuitive outcome demands explanation.

#### 5.1.1 Why Did Derisking Fail?

**1. Market Forces Overwhelmed Policy Interventions**

China's structural advantages - economies of scale, established supply chains, and cost competitiveness - proved insurmountable. Despite tariffs and import restrictions, Indian firms continued sourcing from China because:
- **Price differential**: Chinese products remained 20-40% cheaper than alternatives
- **Quality consistency**: Established suppliers offered reliable quality
- **Supply chain integration**: Switching costs were prohibitively high

**2. COVID-19 Paradox**

The pandemic, which should have accelerated derisking, instead **increased** dependency:
- Supply chain disruptions made China's manufacturing resilience more valuable
- China's early recovery (Q2 2020) made it the only reliable supplier
- Emergency procurement prioritized availability over diversification

**3. Implementation Gaps**

Policy design flaws undermined effectiveness:
- **PLI schemes**: Focused on final assembly, not component manufacturing
- **Make in India**: Lacked complementary infrastructure and skill development
- **Tariff policy**: Raised costs without creating viable alternatives
- **Coordination failure**: Multiple ministries pursued conflicting objectives

**4. China's Strategic Response**

China actively countered India's derisking:
- **Price competition**: Aggressive pricing to maintain market share
- **Product upgrading**: Moved up value chain, increasing dependency
- **Indirect exports**: Routed through third countries (Vietnam, Bangladesh)
- **Investment**: Increased FDI in Indian manufacturing (creating lock-in)

### 5.2 Sector-Specific Insights

#### 5.2.1 Successes: Electronics and Chemicals

**Electronics (SSVI -46%)**:
- PLI scheme for smartphones worked: Apple, Samsung shifted assembly to India
- But component dependency persists: 80% of parts still from China
- **Lesson**: Assembly ≠ manufacturing capability

**Organic Chemicals (SSVI -68%)**:
- Domestic production capacity expanded significantly
- Import substitution successful in bulk chemicals
- **Lesson**: Capital-intensive sectors respond well to PLI

#### 5.2.2 Failures: Pharmaceuticals and Machinery

**Pharmaceuticals (SSVI +68%)**:
- API dependency on China **increased** despite being critical sector
- PLI schemes insufficient to overcome China's scale advantages
- **Lesson**: Strategic sectors need more aggressive intervention

**Machinery (SSVI +5%)**:
- Capital goods dependency persists
- Domestic manufacturing lacks technological capability
- **Lesson**: Technology gap cannot be closed quickly

### 5.3 Revised Policy Recommendations

Given the empirical evidence of policy failure, we recommend a fundamental reassessment of India's derisking strategy.

#### 5.3.1 SHORT-TERM (1-2 years): Manage Increased Dependency

**Since dependency cannot be quickly reduced, focus on risk mitigation:**

**1. Strategic Stockpiling**
- Build 6-12 month reserves of critical imports (APIs, semiconductors, rare earths)
- Cost: ~$5-10 billion (manageable given $700B+ reserves)
- Benefit: Buffer against supply disruptions

**2. Diversification Within China**
- Multiple suppliers rather than single-source
- Geographic spread (not just Guangdong/Zhejiang)
- Contractual safeguards (force majeure clauses)

**3. Enhanced Monitoring**
- Real-time tracking of critical supply chains
- Early warning system for disruptions
- Scenario planning for various contingencies

#### 5.3.2 MEDIUM-TERM (3-5 years): Targeted Capability Building

**Focus on sectors where success is feasible:**

**1. Pharmaceutical Independence**
- **Massive PLI expansion**: $10B over 5 years (vs current $2B)
- **Technology partnerships**: License production from EU/USA
- **Regulatory fast-track**: Accelerate domestic API approvals
- **Target**: 50% self-sufficiency in critical APIs by 2030

**2. Electronics Components (Not Just Assembly)**
- **Semiconductor fabrication**: Partner with Taiwan, South Korea
- **Display manufacturing**: OLED, LCD production facilities
- **Component ecosystem**: PCBs, batteries, cameras
- **Target**: 30% component localization by 2030

**3. Machinery and Capital Goods**
- **Technology acquisition**: Buy struggling European/Japanese firms
- **Skill development**: 100,000 engineers in precision manufacturing
- **R&D investment**: 2% of GDP (currently 0.7%)
- **Target**: 25% import substitution in critical machinery by 2030

#### 5.3.3 LONG-TERM (5-10 years): Structural Transformation

**1. Industrial Policy 2.0**

Current approach (tariffs + subsidies) has failed. Need comprehensive strategy:

**A. Cluster Development**
- **Pharmaceutical clusters**: Hyderabad, Ahmedabad (like China's Taizhou)
- **Electronics clusters**: Bangalore, Chennai (like China's Shenzhen)
- **Machinery clusters**: Pune, Coimbatore (like Germany's Mittelstand)

**B. Infrastructure Investment**
- **Ports**: Reduce logistics costs (currently 14% of GDP vs 8% in China)
- **Power**: Reliable 24/7 electricity (manufacturing requirement)
- **Skills**: Vocational training for 10M workers

**C. Regulatory Reform**
- **Land acquisition**: Streamline process (currently takes 5+ years)
- **Labor laws**: Balance flexibility with protection
- **Environmental clearances**: Fast-track for strategic sectors

**2. Regional Integration**

**India cannot compete with China alone - need regional strategy:**

**A. ASEAN Integration**
- **Free trade**: Reduce tariffs on intermediate goods
- **Supply chain integration**: Become part of regional value chains
- **Joint ventures**: Partner with Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia

**B. Quad Economic Alliance**
- **Technology sharing**: USA, Japan, Australia
- **Investment coordination**: Avoid competing for same FDI
- **Supply chain resilience**: Collective diversification from China

**3. Realistic Expectations**

**Accept that complete derisking is impossible:**
- China is 18% of global GDP, 28% of manufacturing
- Global value chains are deeply integrated
- Some dependency is inevitable and economically efficient

**Goal should be**: Reduce **vulnerability** (not dependency)
- Dependency on non-critical goods: acceptable
- Dependency on strategic goods: minimize
- Ability to withstand disruptions: maximize

### 5.4 Policy Design Principles

**Based on our findings, effective derisking policies must:**

**1. Be Sector-Specific**
- One-size-fits-all approaches fail
- Tailor interventions to sector characteristics
- Prioritize based on strategic importance AND feasibility

**2. Address Root Causes**
- Cost competitiveness (not just tariffs)
- Technology gaps (not just subsidies)
- Infrastructure deficits (not just incentives)

**3. Have Realistic Timelines**
- Manufacturing capability takes 10-15 years to build
- Short-term targets create perverse incentives
- Accept gradual progress over quick fixes

**4. Coordinate Across Government**
- Trade, industrial, technology, education policies must align
- Single nodal agency for derisking (avoid turf wars)
- Clear accountability and measurement

**5. Engage Private Sector**
- Government cannot pick winners
- Create enabling environment, let markets allocate
- Public-private partnerships for risky investments

### 5.5 Lessons for Other Countries

India's experience offers valuable lessons for other nations attempting to derisk from China:

**1. Early Action Matters**
- Dependency is easier to prevent than reverse
- Once supply chains are established, switching costs are high
- Start derisking BEFORE crisis, not after

**2. Market Forces Are Powerful**
- Government interventions can be overwhelmed by economics
- Need massive, sustained investment to overcome cost differentials
- Half-measures worse than no action (raise costs without alternatives)

**3. Strategic Sectors Require Strategic Interventions**
- Normal industrial policy insufficient for critical goods
- May need state-owned enterprises, guaranteed purchases
- National security justifies economic inefficiency

**4. Regional Cooperation Essential**
- No single country can replace China alone
- Collective action more effective than unilateral
- Supply chain diversification requires coordination

### 5.6 Research Agenda

Our findings raise important questions for future research:

**1. Micro-level Analysis**
- Why do firms continue sourcing from China despite incentives?
- What switching costs prevent diversification?
- How do global value chains constrain policy options?

**2. Comparative Studies**
- How do other countries' derisking efforts compare?
- What policies have worked elsewhere?
- Can successful models be adapted to India?

**3. Political Economy**
- Why do policymakers persist with failing strategies?
- What domestic political constraints limit options?
- How do interest groups shape derisking policy?

**4. Alternative Strategies**
- Is "friendshoring" more effective than derisking?
- Can technology (AI, automation) reduce dependency?
- What role for international institutions (WTO, IMF)?

### 5.7 Conclusion

India's derisking initiative represents a **policy failure** with important lessons. The finding that dependency **increased** rather than decreased - and that the policy intervention **accelerated** this trend - challenges conventional wisdom about economic statecraft effectiveness.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Market forces matter**: Economic fundamentals (cost, quality, scale) can overwhelm policy interventions
2. **Implementation is critical**: Well-designed policies fail without effective execution
3. **Realistic goals essential**: Complete derisking from China is neither feasible nor desirable
4. **Vulnerability ≠ Dependency**: Focus should be on reducing vulnerability to disruptions, not eliminating all trade
5. **Long-term perspective**: Manufacturing capability takes decades to build, not years

**The path forward** requires:
- Honest assessment of what failed and why
- Realistic goals based on feasibility, not aspiration
- Massive, sustained investment in capability building
- Regional cooperation to collectively reduce dependence
- Acceptance that some dependency is inevitable

India's experience demonstrates that **attempted derisking can backfire** if not carefully designed and implemented. Other countries should learn from these mistakes rather than repeat them.
