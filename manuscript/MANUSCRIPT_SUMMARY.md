## Key Findings

### Main Result: Policy Failure

**TDI (Trade Dependency Index)**:
- Baseline: 15.47% [14.30, 16.80]
- Intervention: 21.86% [20.65, 23.00]
- Change: +6.39% (p<0.0001, Cohen's d=3.385)
- **Conclusion**: Dependency **increased** significantly

**Structural Break**:
- Pre-2020: +0.53%/year
- Post-2020: +0.90%/year
- Acceleration: +0.36%/year (69% faster)
- **Conclusion**: Policy **accelerated** dependency increase

**All Hypotheses Rejected**:
- H1 (TDI decreases): ❌ REJECTED
- H2 (HHI decreases): ❌ REJECTED
- H3 (CPODS > 1): ❌ REJECTED
- H5 (SSVI decreases): ⚠️ PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

## Theoretical Contributions

### 1. Asymmetric Interdependence Can Deepen Through Derisking

**Finding**: Attempted derisking **increased** vulnerability

**Mechanism**:
- Structural advantages (scale, cost) overwhelm policy
- External shocks (COVID) reinforce dependency
- Target country (China) adapts strategically

**Implication**: Path dependence resists policy intervention

### 2. Weaponized Interdependence May Be Unavoidable

**Finding**: Chokepoint power **increased** despite diversification

**Mechanism**:
- Network effects create lock-in
- Scale economies make concentration efficient
- Technology gaps cannot be quickly closed

**Implication**: Some chokepoints are structural, not policy-amenable

### 3. Economic Statecraft Requires Realistic Assessment

**Finding**: Policies failed due to unrealistic expectations

**Necessary conditions**:
- Viable alternatives exist
- Domestic capacity can be built
- Time horizon matches capability building

**Implication**: Not all dependencies are reversible

## Policy Implications

### Short-Term (1-2 years): Manage Dependency

1. **Strategic stockpiling** ($5-10B)
2. **Diversification within China**
3. **Enhanced monitoring**

### Medium-Term (3-5 years): Targeted Capability

1. **Pharmaceutical independence** ($10B PLI)
2. **Electronics components** ($25-30B)
3. **Machinery** ($15-20B)

### Long-Term (5-10 years): Structural Transformation

1. **Industrial Policy 2.0** (clusters, infrastructure, regulation)
2. **Regional integration** (ASEAN, Quad)
3. **Realistic expectations** (reduce vulnerability, not dependency)
