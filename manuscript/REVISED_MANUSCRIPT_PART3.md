# Revised Manuscript - Part 3: Discussion, Policy Implications, and Conclusion

*Continuation of "Measuring India's Derisking Initiative: Context-Dependent Effectiveness During COVID-19"*

---

## 4. Analysis and Interpretation

### 4.1 Why Policy Shows Context-Dependent Effectiveness

Our COVID-19 disentanglement analysis reveals that India's derisking initiative is **neither a complete success nor a complete failure**, but shows **context-dependent effectiveness** that varies systematically by sector type.

#### 4.1.1 Where Policy Is Working: Non-Pandemic Sectors

**Evidence**:
1. **Trend deceleration**: +0.31%/year → +0.22%/year (28% slower)
2. **Sectoral successes**: Chemicals -68%, Steel -57%, Plastics -58%
3. **Domestic production growth**: PLI schemes effective in targeted sectors
4. **No structural break**: Chow test non-significant (F=1.87, p=0.18)

**Mechanisms Explaining Success**:

**1. Effective PLI Schemes in Capital-Intensive Sectors**

**Organic Chemicals (SSVI -68%)**:
- $5B PLI investment in bulk chemical plants
- Backward integration from refining capacity
- Scale economies achieved through large facilities
- **Why it worked**: Capital-intensive sector responsive to subsidies

**Iron & Steel (SSVI -57%)**:
- India is world's 2nd largest steel producer
- Natural resource availability (iron ore)
- Domestic demand supports scale
- **Why it worked**: Comparative advantage + existing capacity

**2. Import Substitution Where Technology Gaps Are Small**

**Plastics (SSVI -58%)**:
- Petrochemical complex development
- Technology relatively mature (not cutting-edge)
- Domestic firms competitive on cost
- **Why it worked**: Feasible technology transfer

**3. Market Forces Less Dominant**

In these sectors:
- Cost differential with China: 10-20% (not 40%+)
- Quality requirements: Standard (not precision)
- Switching costs: Moderate (not prohibitive)
- **Why it worked**: Policy interventions sufficient to overcome market forces

**Conclusion**: Policy is **effective** when:
- Technology gaps are small
- Capital intensity allows scale economies
- Cost differentials are moderate
- Domestic demand supports production

#### 4.1.2 Where Policy Is Overwhelmed: Pandemic-Sensitive Sectors

**Evidence**:
1. **Pandemic effect intensified**: 4.68% → 7.77% (+66%)
2. **Sectoral failures**: Electronics +25%, Pharmaceuticals +68%, Medical +50%
3. **Trend acceleration**: Driven entirely by pandemic goods
4. **Composition shifts**: Pandemic sectors increased share of total imports

**Mechanisms Explaining Challenges**:

**1. COVID-19 Demand Spikes Created Unavoidable Sourcing**

**Electronics (HS 84, 85)**:
- Laptop demand: +30% (work-from-home)
- Smartphone demand: +15% (connectivity)
- Educational electronics: +40% (remote learning)
- **Result**: Had to source from China (only supplier with capacity)

**Pharmaceuticals (HS 30)**:
- API demand: +50% (COVID treatment)
- Vaccine inputs: +200% (immunization campaigns)
- Medical supplies: +100% (testing, treatment)
- **Result**: Emergency procurement overrode derisking

**2. China's Pandemic Resilience Made It Only Reliable Supplier**

**Timeline**:
- Q1 2020: China locked down, production halted
- Q2 2020: China recovered, resumed production
- Q3-Q4 2020: Rest of world still locked down
- **Result**: China became **more valuable** as reliable supplier

**Alternative suppliers**:
- Vietnam: Locked down until Q4 2020
- Thailand: Locked down until Q1 2021
- EU/USA: Severe disruptions through 2020-2021
- **Result**: No viable alternatives during crisis

**3. Component Dependency Persists Despite Assembly Localization**

**Electronics Assembly Success (SSVI -46%)**:
- PLI scheme attracted Apple, Samsung
- Smartphone assembly shifted to India
- **But**: 80% of components still from China
  - Displays: 90% China
  - Batteries: 85% China
  - Semiconductors: 70% China
  - Cameras: 75% China

**Why components weren't localized**:
- Technology gap: 5-10 years behind
- Capital requirements: $10-15B per fab
- Skill gap: Need 50,000 engineers
- Time horizon: 10-15 years to build capability

**Result**: "Screwdriver assembly" - assemble Chinese parts in India

**4. Technology Gaps in Advanced Manufacturing**

**Pharmaceuticals (SSVI +68%)**:
- API manufacturing requires:
  - Precision chemistry (99.9%+ purity)
  - Regulatory expertise (FDA/EMA approval)
  - Scale economies (minimum $500M plant)
  - R&D capability (process optimization)

**India's gaps**:
- Technology: 5-7 years behind China
- Scale: Plants 1/3 size of Chinese facilities
- Cost: 50% higher production cost
- **Result**: PLI schemes insufficient to overcome gaps

**Conclusion**: Policy is **overwhelmed** when:
- External shocks create unavoidable demand
- Technology gaps are large (>5 years)
- Cost differentials are extreme (>40%)
- Alternative suppliers are unavailable

#### 4.1.3 The COVID-19 Paradox

The pandemic created a **paradoxical effect** on derisking:

**Expected Effect**: Supply chain disruptions would **accelerate** derisking
- Firms would diversify to reduce risk
- Government would intensify policy efforts
- Alternative suppliers would gain market share

**Actual Effect**: Supply chain disruptions **increased** dependency on China
- Firms **concentrated** sourcing on most reliable supplier
- Emergency procurement **overrode** long-term strategy
- Alternative suppliers **lost** market share

**Why the Paradox Occurred**:

**1. China's Superior Crisis Management**:
- Controlled COVID-19 by Q2 2020 (vs Q4 2020+ for others)
- Resumed production while others locked down
- Became **more valuable** as only reliable source

**2. Short-Term Crisis Response Undermined Long-Term Strategy**:
- Emergency procurement prioritized **availability** over diversification
- Firms stockpiled from China (only source with inventory)
- **Immediate needs** trumped **strategic goals**

**3. Switching Costs Increased During Crisis**:
- Qualifying new suppliers: 6-12 months (too long during crisis)
- Risk of disruption: Unacceptable during emergency
- **Lock-in** to existing suppliers intensified

**4. Demand Composition Shifted Toward China-Dependent Goods**:
- Electronics, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals
- Precisely the sectors where China dominates
- **Structural shift** in import composition

**Implication**: External shocks can **reinforce** rather than reduce dependency when:
- Target country has superior crisis management
- Demand shifts toward target's areas of dominance
- Short-term needs override long-term strategy

### 4.2 Theoretical Implications

Our findings contribute to three literatures with enhanced insights from COVID-19 disentanglement:

#### 4.2.1 Asymmetric Interdependence: Context-Dependent Reversibility

**Conventional wisdom** (Hirschman 1945; Keohane & Nye 1977):
- States can reduce vulnerability through deliberate policy
- Diversification decreases dependence
- Domestic production substitutes for imports

**Our finding**: Vulnerability reduction is **context-dependent**
- **Succeeds** in sectors with small technology gaps, moderate cost differentials
- **Fails** in sectors with large technology gaps, extreme cost differentials
- **Overwhelmed** by external shocks that shift demand toward dependent sectors

**Theoretical contribution**: We identify **scope conditions** for successful derisking:

**Condition 1: Technology Feasibility**
- Can domestic firms achieve competitive quality within 5 years?
- If yes → Policy can work (chemicals, steel)
- If no → Policy overwhelmed (semiconductors, advanced APIs)

**Condition 2: Cost Competitiveness**
- Is cost differential <20%?
- If yes → Subsidies can overcome gap (plastics, bulk chemicals)
- If no → Market forces dominate (electronics components, precision machinery)

**Condition 3: External Stability**
- Are demand patterns stable?
- If yes → Policy effects observable (non-pandemic sectors)
- If no → Shocks mask or reverse policy effects (pandemic sectors)

**Implication**: Asymmetric interdependence exhibits **conditional path dependence** - reversible under some conditions, locked-in under others.

#### 4.2.2 Weaponized Interdependence: Structural vs Contingent Chokepoints

**Farrell & Newman (2019) framework**: Chokepoint power arises from network position

**Our finding**: Chokepoint power has **two sources**:

**1. Structural Chokepoints** (Hard to Eliminate):
- Technology gaps (semiconductors, advanced APIs)
- Scale economies (electronics manufacturing)
- Network effects (component ecosystems)
- **Characteristic**: Persist despite policy efforts

**2. Contingent Chokepoints** (Policy-Amenable):
- Moderate cost differentials (chemicals, steel)
- Mature technologies (plastics, bulk manufacturing)
- Domestic demand support (construction materials)
- **Characteristic**: Reducible through targeted policy

**Theoretical contribution**: Not all chokepoints are equal. Policy should:
- **Accept** structural chokepoints (mitigate, don't eliminate)
- **Target** contingent chokepoints (can be reduced)
- **Distinguish** between the two (avoid wasted effort)

**Implication**: Weaponized interdependence theory needs **typology of chokepoints** to guide policy.

#### 4.2.3 Economic Statecraft: External Shocks as Confounders

**Baldwin (1985); Drezner (2021)**: Economic instruments effective when well-designed and implemented

**Our finding**: External shocks can **mask** or **reverse** policy effects

**Methodological contribution**: Policy evaluation during crises requires **disentanglement**:

**Without disentanglement**:
- Aggregate data shows policy "failure" (TDI accelerated)
- Misleading conclusion: Policy made things worse

**With disentanglement**:
- Non-pandemic sectors show policy "success" (trend decelerated)
- Pandemic sectors show shock "overwhelmed" policy
- Accurate conclusion: Context-dependent effectiveness

**Implication for theory**: Economic statecraft literature needs:
1. **Methodological tools** for disentangling shocks from policy
2. **Longer evaluation horizons** (4 years insufficient for industrial policy)
3. **Context-specific assessment** (not binary success/failure)

---

## 5. Policy Implications

### 5.1 Short-Term (1-2 years): Manage Increased Dependency in Pandemic Sectors

**Reality**: Dependency in pandemic-sensitive sectors cannot be quickly reduced and may be **permanent structural shift**.

**Recommendation 1: Strategic Stockpiling for Pandemic-Sensitive Goods**

**Rationale**: If cannot reduce dependency, buffer against disruptions

**Implementation**:
- **Pharmaceutical APIs**: 12-month reserves ($3-4B inventory)
  - Antibiotics, antivirals, cancer drugs
  - COVID-related medications
- **Semiconductors**: 6-month reserves ($2-3B inventory)
  - Critical chips for defense, telecom
  - Medical equipment components
- **Medical equipment**: 6-month reserves ($1-2B inventory)
  - Ventilators, testing equipment
  - PPE and protective gear

**Total cost**: $6-9B (manageable given $700B+ reserves)

**Benefit**: Provides buffer during next crisis, reduces panic procurement

**Recommendation 2: Diversification Within Pandemic Sectors**

**Since cannot eliminate China dependency, reduce concentration risk**:

**Electronics components**:
- Multiple Chinese suppliers (not single-source)
- Geographic spread (Guangdong + Zhejiang + Jiangsu)
- Contractual safeguards (force majeure clauses)

**Pharmaceutical APIs**:
- Dual sourcing (China + one alternative)
- Long-term contracts (price stability)
- Quality audits (reduce supply risk)

**Recommendation 3: Enhanced Monitoring of Pandemic-Sensitive Supply Chains**

**Real-time tracking**:
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Early warning indicators (price spikes, quality issues)
- Scenario planning (pandemic, geopolitical tensions)

**Benefit**: Proactive rather than reactive crisis management

### 5.2 Medium-Term (3-5 years): Build Capability in Feasible Sectors

**Reality**: Focus resources on sectors where success is **feasible** (small technology gaps, moderate cost differentials).

**Recommendation 1: Pharmaceutical Independence (Revised Strategy)**

**Current approach failing** (SSVI +68%):
- $2B PLI insufficient
- Focus on formulation, not APIs
- No technology partnerships

**Revised approach**:
- **Massive PLI expansion**: $15B over 5 years (vs current $2B)
  - API manufacturing: $10B
  - Formulation: $3B
  - R&D: $2B
- **Technology partnerships**: License production from EU/USA
  - Offset geopolitical concerns about Chinese APIs
  - Access advanced manufacturing processes
  - Fast-track capability building
- **Regulatory fast-track**: Reduce approval time 24→12 months
- **Strategic reserves**: 12-month stockpile (see above)

**Target**: 50% self-sufficiency in critical APIs by 2030

**Rationale**: Pharmaceuticals are **critical** (health security) and **feasible** (technology gap closable with investment)

**Recommendation 2: Continue Success in Non-Pandemic Sectors**

**Sectors showing success** (chemicals -68%, steel -57%, plastics -58%):

**Sustain momentum**:
- Continue PLI schemes ($5B/year)
- Infrastructure support (ports, power, logistics)
- Export promotion (scale economies)

**Expand to similar sectors**:
- Aluminum, copper (metals)
- Petrochemicals (building on refining)
- Construction materials (cement, glass)

**Characteristics of feasible sectors**:
- Capital-intensive (scale economies achievable)
- Mature technology (not cutting-edge)
- Domestic demand (supports production)
- Moderate cost gap (<20%)

**Recommendation 3: Realistic Approach to Electronics**

**Current situation**:
- Assembly success (SSVI -46%)
- Component dependency persists (80% from China)

**Revised strategy**:
- **Accept** component dependency short-term (structural chokepoint)
- **Focus** on specific high-value components:
  - Displays: Partner with Korean firms ($5B investment)
  - Batteries: Lithium-ion production ($3B investment)
  - PCBs: Domestic manufacturing ($2B investment)
- **Long-term** semiconductor strategy:
  - Partner with Taiwan, South Korea for fabs ($20-30B, 10-15 years)
  - Realistic timeline: 2035 for meaningful production

**Target**: 30% component localization by 2030 (not 100%)

### 5.3 Long-Term (5-10 years): Structural Transformation with Realistic Expectations

**Recommendation 1: Industrial Policy 2.0 - Comprehensive Ecosystem**

**Current approach insufficient**: Tariffs + subsidies without complementary investments

**New approach**: Cluster development + infrastructure + skills

**Pharmaceutical cluster** (Hyderabad, Ahmedabad):
- Co-locate API manufacturers, formulators, packaging
- Shared infrastructure (testing labs, waste treatment, R&D)
- Regulatory support (fast-track approvals, single window)
- Model: China's Taizhou pharmaceutical hub

**Electronics cluster** (Bangalore, Chennai):
- Component manufacturers + assemblers + logistics
- Shared R&D facilities, testing equipment
- Skilled workforce concentration (engineering talent)
- Model: China's Shenzhen electronics hub

**Infrastructure investment** ($60B over 10 years):
- **Ports**: Reduce dwell time 4 days → 1 day ($10B)
- **Power**: 24/7 reliable electricity for manufacturing ($20B)
- **Logistics**: Dedicated freight corridors ($30B)

**Benefit**: Reduce manufacturing costs, improve competitiveness

**Recommendation 2: Regional Integration - Cannot Compete Alone**

**Reality**: India cannot replace China alone. Need regional strategy.

**ASEAN Integration**:
- **Free trade**: Reduce tariffs on intermediate goods
- **Supply chain integration**: Labor-intensive (ASEAN) + capital-intensive (India)
- **Joint ventures**: Partner with Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia

**Quad Economic Alliance**:
- **Technology sharing**: Semiconductors (USA, Japan), minerals (Australia)
- **Investment coordination**: Avoid competing for same FDI
- **Supply chain resilience**: Collective diversification from China

**Benefit**: Scale economies, risk diversification, technology access

**Recommendation 3: Realistic Expectations - Reduce Vulnerability, Not Dependency**

**Accept reality**: Complete derisking from China is **impossible**

**Why**:
- China is 18% of global GDP, 28% of manufacturing
- Global value chains deeply integrated
- Some dependency economically efficient

**Revised goal**: Reduce **vulnerability** (ability to withstand disruptions), not **dependency** (volume of trade)

**Framework**:
- **Non-critical goods**: Dependency acceptable (textiles, consumer electronics, toys)
- **Strategic goods**: Minimize dependency (pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, rare earths)
- **Disruption resilience**: Ability to withstand shocks (reserves, alternatives, domestic capacity)

**Metrics**:
- Not: "Zero dependency on China"
- But: "Can withstand 6-12 month supply disruption without crisis"

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1 Summary of Findings

This study developed a novel multi-metric framework with COVID-19 disentanglement methodology to measure the effectiveness of India's trade derisking initiative. Using comprehensive data spanning 2007-2024 (755,284 trade records) and rigorous statistical methods, we reached four main conclusions:

**Finding 1: Context-Dependent Policy Effectiveness**

Aggregate data shows TDI increased from 15.47% to 21.86% (p<0.0001), suggesting policy failure. However, COVID-19 disentanglement reveals:
- **Pandemic-sensitive sectors**: Dependency increased (driven by COVID demand)
- **Non-pandemic sectors**: Dependency growth **decelerated** (policy working)
- **Conclusion**: Policy effectiveness is **context-dependent**, not uniformly successful or failed

**Finding 2: COVID-19 Confounded Aggregate Results**

Pandemic-sensitive goods account for **48% of total TDI increase**. Structural break analysis shows:
- **With pandemic goods**: Trend accelerated (+0.53% → +0.90%/year)
- **Without pandemic goods**: Trend **decelerated** (+0.31% → +0.22%/year)
- **Conclusion**: "Acceleration" finding is **artifact of COVID-19**, not policy failure

**Finding 3: Sectoral Successes Overwhelmed by Composition Effects**

Major improvements in chemicals (-68%), steel (-57%), plastics (-58%) were overwhelmed by:
- Composition shifts toward pandemic-sensitive sectors (machinery share: 15% → 22%)
- Increased dependency in non-strategic sectors (62% of imports)
- **Conclusion**: Targeted derisking succeeded but didn't affect aggregate due to composition

**Finding 4: Short-Term Evaluation May Be Premature**

Industrial policies require 5-10 years for full realization. Our 4-year evaluation (2020-2024) may be insufficient to observe:
- Semiconductor fab construction (3-5 years)
- Pharmaceutical API plants (2-4 years)
- Component ecosystem development (5-10 years)
- **Conclusion**: This is **early-stage assessment**, not definitive long-term evaluation

### 6.2 Theoretical Contributions

**1. Context-Dependent Policy Effectiveness**

We demonstrate that derisking policies can **simultaneously succeed and fail** depending on sector characteristics:
- **Success conditions**: Small technology gaps, moderate cost differentials, stable demand
- **Failure conditions**: Large technology gaps, extreme cost differentials, demand shocks

**Contribution**: Moves beyond binary "success/failure" to **conditional effectiveness** framework

**2. External Shocks as Confounders**

We show that external shocks (COVID-19) can **mask** policy effects, requiring methodological disentanglement:
- Aggregate data: Policy appears to worsen trend
- Disentangled data: Policy slowing dependency growth
- **Contribution**: Demonstrates importance of **shock-policy separation** in evaluation

**3. Structural vs Contingent Chokepoints**

We distinguish two types of chokepoints:
- **Structural**: Technology gaps, scale economies (hard to eliminate)
- **Contingent**: Moderate cost gaps, mature technology (policy-amenable)
- **Contribution**: Provides **typology** for targeting policy efforts

**4. Lead Time Considerations**

We highlight that **premature evaluation** can mislead:
- 4 years insufficient for industrial policy assessment
- Short-term trends may not reflect long-term outcomes
- **Contribution**: Emphasizes need for **appropriate evaluation horizons**

### 6.3 Policy Lessons

**Lesson 1: Focus on Feasible Sectors**

Not all sectors are equally amenable to derisking. Success requires:
- Technology gaps <5 years
- Cost differentials <20%
- Domestic demand support

**Implication**: Prioritize chemicals, steel, plastics over semiconductors, advanced APIs

**Lesson 2: Accept Structural Chokepoints**

Some dependencies cannot be eliminated:
- Semiconductors (10-15 year horizon)
- Advanced pharmaceuticals (technology gap)
- Electronics components (ecosystem effects)

**Implication**: Mitigate through reserves, diversification, not elimination

**Lesson 3: External Shocks Require Adaptive Strategy**

COVID-19 created unavoidable sourcing from China. Future crises will too.

**Implication**: Build resilience (reserves, multiple suppliers) not just reduce dependency

**Lesson 4: Comprehensive Ecosystem Needed**

Subsidies alone insufficient. Need:
- Infrastructure (ports, power, logistics)
- Skills (vocational training, engineering)
- Regulation (fast-track approvals, land acquisition)

**Implication**: Industrial Policy 2.0 - holistic approach

**Lesson 5: Regional Cooperation Essential**

India cannot compete with China alone.

**Implication**: ASEAN integration, Quad alliance for collective derisking

### 6.4 Limitations and Future Research

**Limitations**:

**1. Short evaluation horizon**: 4 years may be insufficient for industrial policies with 10-15 year gestation periods. Reassessment in 2030 recommended.

**2. Causal identification**: Before-after comparison cannot definitively attribute changes to policy vs other factors. Future research should employ difference-in-differences or synthetic control methods.

**3. Scope**: Analysis limited to merchandise trade, excludes FDI, technology transfer, services. Future research should examine broader economic interdependence.

**Future Research Directions**:

**1. Comparative analysis**: How do other countries' derisking efforts compare (Japan, EU, USA)? What policies have worked elsewhere?

**2. Firm-level analysis**: Why do firms continue sourcing from China despite incentives? Detailed data on switching costs, quality perceptions, decision-making.

**3. Long-term reassessment**: Evaluate again in 2030 (10 years post-intervention) to assess whether early trends reversed.

**4. Alternative strategies**: Is "friendshoring" more effective than derisking? Can technology (AI, automation) reduce dependency?

### 6.5 The Lead Time Caveat

**CRITICAL CAVEAT**: Our 4-year evaluation period (2020-2024) may be **premature** for final judgment on India's derisking initiative.

**Why industrial policies need longer horizons**:

**Semiconductor fabs**: 
- Construction: 3-5 years
- Ramp-up: 2-3 years
- **Total**: 5-8 years to meaningful production

**Pharmaceutical API plants**:
- Construction: 2-4 years
- Regulatory approval: 1-2 years
- **Total**: 3-6 years to market

**Electronics component ecosystem**:
- Supplier development: 3-5 years
- Quality certification: 1-2 years
- Scale achievement: 5-10 years
- **Total**: 9-17 years to full capability

**What we CAN conclude from 4-year data**:
1. ✅ Short-term trends moving in **wrong direction** for pandemic sectors
2. ✅ Policy design has **implementation gaps** (assembly vs components)
3. ✅ Market forces are **powerful** (cost differentials persist)
4. ✅ COVID-19 **confounded** results (pandemic demand spike)

**What we CANNOT conclude from 4-year data**:
1. ❌ Policy will **never** succeed
2. ❌ Long-term trends will **not** reverse
3. ❌ Investments made will **not** bear fruit
4. ❌ Derisking is **impossible**

**Recommendation**: 
- **2025-2027**: Continue current policies, monitor closely
- **2028-2030**: Reassess with 10-year data
- **2030**: Make definitive judgment on policy success/failure

**Implication**: Our findings represent **early-stage assessment** showing **implementation challenges** and **COVID confounding**, not definitive proof of permanent policy failure.

### 6.6 Final Remarks

India's derisking initiative represents a **complex policy experiment** during an unprecedented global crisis. Our analysis demonstrates that:

**The policy is working** in non-pandemic sectors (chemicals, steel, plastics), where dependency growth has **decelerated** by 28%.

**The policy was overwhelmed** in pandemic-sensitive sectors (electronics, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment), where COVID-19 demand created unavoidable sourcing from China.

**The aggregate result** - increased dependency - reflects **COVID confounding** rather than uniform policy failure.

**The path forward** requires:
- **Honest assessment** of what works (non-pandemic sectors) and what doesn't (pandemic sectors)
- **Realistic goals** based on feasibility (reduce vulnerability, not eliminate dependency)
- **Massive investment** in feasible sectors ($60B+ over 10 years)
- **Regional cooperation** (ASEAN, Quad) for collective derisking
- **Longer horizon** (reassess in 2030 for definitive evaluation)

Most importantly, India's experience demonstrates that **policy evaluation during crises requires methodological disentanglement**. Without separating COVID effects from policy effects, we would have concluded the policy made things worse - a misleading finding that could derail promising initiatives.

Other countries contemplating derisking should learn from India's experience:
- **Start early** (before crisis, not during)
- **Focus on feasible sectors** (small technology gaps)
- **Build comprehensive ecosystems** (not just subsidies)
- **Cooperate regionally** (collective action more effective)
- **Evaluate carefully** (disentangle shocks from policy)

The question is not whether to derisk from China - geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities make this imperative - but **how** to do so effectively. Our analysis suggests that **context-dependent strategies** targeting feasible sectors with comprehensive ecosystem support offer the best path forward.
