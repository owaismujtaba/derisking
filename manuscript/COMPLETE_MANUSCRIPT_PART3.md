## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Theoretical Implications

Our findings challenge three core assumptions in economic statecraft literature.

#### 5.1.1 Asymmetric Interdependence Can Deepen Through Derisking Attempts

**Conventional wisdom** (Hirschman 1945; Keohane & Nye 1977):
- States can reduce vulnerability through deliberate policy
- Diversification decreases dependence
- Domestic production substitutes for imports

**Our finding**: Attempted derisking **increased** vulnerability
- TDI rose from 15.47% to 21.86% (+41%)
- Dependency accelerated post-intervention (+0.90%/year vs +0.53%/year)

**Theoretical contribution**: We identify conditions under which derisking **backfires**:

**Condition 1: Structural Advantage Favors Target**
- When target country (China) has overwhelming cost/scale advantages
- Policy interventions (tariffs, subsidies) insufficient to overcome fundamentals
- Market forces reassert themselves despite government efforts

**Condition 2: Crisis Reinforces Dependency**
- External shocks (COVID-19) can **increase** reliance on resilient suppliers
- Short-term crisis response undermines long-term derisking
- Target country's superior crisis management increases its value

**Condition 3: Target Adapts Strategically**
- Target country (China) responds with counter-measures
- Aggressive pricing, product upgrading, indirect exports
- Policy effectiveness erodes over time

**Implication for theory**: Asymmetric interdependence is not easily reversed through policy. Structural factors (economies of scale, supply chain integration, technological capability) create **path dependence** that resists government intervention.

#### 5.1.2 Weaponized Interdependence May Be Unavoidable

**Farrell & Newman (2019) framework**: States can reduce chokepoint vulnerability through:
- Network diversification
- Node redundancy
- Alternative pathways

**Our finding**: Chokepoint power **increased** despite diversification efforts
- HHI rose from 670.88 to 764.00 (+14%)
- SCRS declined from 67.69 to 66.40 (-2%)
- China's share increased while alternatives stagnated

**Theoretical contribution**: Chokepoint power may be **structural**, not policy-amenable:

**Mechanism 1: Network Effects**
- China's central position in global value chains creates lock-in
- Switching costs prohibitively high (relationship-specific investments)
- First-mover advantages compound over time

**Mechanism 2: Scale Economies**
- China's manufacturing scale (28% of global output) creates cost advantages
- Smaller alternatives cannot match pricing
- Concentration is economically efficient (even if strategically risky)

**Mechanism 3: Technology Gaps**
- Advanced manufacturing requires capabilities built over decades
- Cannot be quickly replicated through subsidies alone
- Path-dependent technological development

**Implication for theory**: Some chokepoints may be **unavoidable** given economic fundamentals. Policy can mitigate but not eliminate weaponized interdependence when structural advantages are overwhelming.

#### 5.1.3 Economic Statecraft Effectiveness Requires Realistic Assessment

**Baldwin (1985) framework**: Economic instruments effective when:
- Objectives clear
- Instruments matched to targets
- Implementation capacity sufficient

**Our finding**: All three conditions violated in India's case:

**Objective clarity**: ✅ (Reduce China dependency)
**Instrument-target matching**: ❌ (Tariffs insufficient for 40% cost gap)
**Implementation capacity**: ❌ (Infrastructure, skills, coordination gaps)

**Theoretical contribution**: We identify **necessary conditions** for economic statecraft success:

**Condition 1: Viable Alternatives Exist**
- Must have suppliers that can substitute at reasonable cost
- India's case: No alternatives matched China's cost/quality/scale
- Policy failure was **predictable** given lack of substitutes

**Condition 2: Domestic Capacity Can Be Built**
- Requires complementary investments (infrastructure, skills, technology)
- India's case: PLI schemes without infrastructure/skill development
- **Necessary but not sufficient**: Subsidies alone inadequate

**Condition 3: Time Horizon Matches Capability Building**
- Manufacturing capability takes 10-15 years to develop
- India's case: 5-year evaluation too short
- **Premature assessment** may underestimate long-term effects

**Implication for theory**: Economic statecraft literature needs more **realistic assessment** of when policies can succeed. Not all dependencies are reversible through policy, and acknowledging limits is crucial for effective strategy.

## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1 Summary of Findings

This study developed a novel multi-metric framework to measure the effectiveness of India's trade derisking initiative aimed at reducing dependency on China. Using comprehensive data spanning 2007-2024 (755,284 trade records) and rigorous statistical methods (bootstrap confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, structural break analysis), we reached three main conclusions:

**Finding 1: Derisking Initiative Failed**

India's Trade Dependency Index on China **increased** from 15.47% (baseline: 2007-2019) to 21.86% (intervention: 2020-2024), a statistically significant increase (p<0.0001) with very large effect size (Cohen's d=3.385). This directly contradicts the policy objective of reducing dependency.

**Finding 2: Policy Intervention Accelerated Dependency**

Structural break analysis reveals that the 2020 Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative **accelerated** rather than reversed the upward trend in dependency. The pre-2020 trend (+0.53%/year) increased to +0.90%/year post-2020, a 69% acceleration. This suggests the policy not only failed but may have been counterproductive.

**Finding 3: Systematic Failure Across Metrics**

All four testable hypotheses were rejected:
- H1 (TDI decreases): REJECTED - increased significantly
- H2 (HHI decreases): REJECTED - increased marginally  
- H3 (CPODS > 1): REJECTED - only 0.34
- H5 (SSVI decreases): PARTIALLY SUPPORTED - mixed results

Only sectoral analysis showed partial success (electronics -46%, chemicals -68%), but these were overwhelmed by failures in other sectors (pharmaceuticals +68%, machinery +5%) and composition effects.

### 6.2 Theoretical Contributions

Our findings contribute to three literatures:

**1. Asymmetric Interdependence Theory**

We demonstrate that attempted derisking can **paradoxically increase** vulnerability when:
- Target country has overwhelming structural advantages (scale, cost, technology)
- External shocks reinforce rather than reduce dependency
- Target country adapts strategically to counter-measures

**Implication**: Asymmetric interdependence exhibits **path dependence** that resists policy intervention. Vulnerability is not easily reversed through government action when economic fundamentals favor the target country.

**2. Weaponized Interdependence Theory**

We show that chokepoint power may be **structural** rather than policy-amenable:
- Network effects create lock-in (switching costs, relationship-specific investments)
- Scale economies make concentration economically efficient
- Technology gaps cannot be quickly closed through subsidies

**Implication**: Some chokepoints may be unavoidable given economic realities. Policy can mitigate but not eliminate weaponized interdependence when structural advantages are overwhelming.

**3. Economic Statecraft Effectiveness**

We identify **necessary conditions** for economic statecraft success:
- Viable alternatives must exist (substitutes at reasonable cost)
- Domestic capacity can be built (complementary investments in infrastructure, skills)
- Time horizon matches capability building (10-15 years for manufacturing)

**Implication**: Economic statecraft literature needs more realistic assessment of when policies can succeed. Not all dependencies are reversible, and acknowledging limits is crucial for effective strategy.

### 6.3 Policy Lessons

India's experience offers valuable lessons for policymakers:

**Lesson 1: Market Forces Matter**

Economic fundamentals (cost, quality, scale) can overwhelm policy interventions. Tariffs and subsidies are insufficient when cost gaps are 40%+ and structural advantages favor the target country.

**Lesson 2: Implementation Is Critical**

Well-designed policies fail without effective execution. India's PLI schemes focused on assembly (easy) rather than components (hard), lacked complementary infrastructure investments, and suffered from coordination failures across ministries.

**Lesson 3: Realistic Goals Essential**

Complete derisking from China is neither feasible nor desirable. The goal should be reducing **vulnerability** (ability to withstand disruptions) rather than eliminating **dependency** (volume of trade).

**Lesson 4: Long-Term Perspective Required**

Manufacturing capability takes 10-15 years to build, not 3-5 years. Short-term assessments may underestimate eventual policy effects, but current trends suggest fundamental problems rather than implementation lags.

**Lesson 5: Regional Cooperation Needed**

No single country can replace China alone. Collective action through regional integration (ASEAN) and strategic partnerships (Quad) more effective than unilateral efforts.

### 6.4 Limitations and Future Research

**Limitations**:

1. **Causal identification**: Before-after comparison cannot definitively attribute changes to policy vs other factors (COVID-19, global trends). Future research should employ difference-in-differences or synthetic control methods with comparison countries.

2. **Time horizon**: Intervention period only 5 years (2020-2024). Manufacturing capability building takes longer. Future research should reassess after 10-15 years.

3. **Scope**: Analysis limited to merchandise trade, excludes FDI, technology transfer, services. Future research should examine broader economic interdependence.

**Future Research Directions**:

1. **Micro-level analysis**: Why do firms continue sourcing from China despite incentives? Detailed firm-level data on switching costs, quality perceptions, and decision-making.

2. **Comparative studies**: How do other countries' derisking efforts compare (Japan, EU, USA)? What policies have worked elsewhere? Can successful models be adapted?

3. **Political economy**: Why do policymakers persist with failing strategies? What domestic political constraints limit options? How do interest groups shape derisking policy?

4. **Alternative strategies**: Is "friendshoring" more effective than derisking? Can technology (AI, automation) reduce dependency? What role for international institutions?

### 6.5 Final Remarks

India's derisking initiative represents a **policy failure** with important lessons for economic statecraft. The finding that dependency **increased** rather than decreased—and that the policy intervention **accelerated** this trend—challenges conventional wisdom about government capacity to reshape trade relationships.

However, this failure is **instructive** rather than merely disappointing. It demonstrates the limits of economic policy when structural factors favor the target country, highlights the importance of realistic goal-setting, and underscores the need for comprehensive rather than piecemeal approaches.

The path forward requires:
- **Honest assessment** of what failed and why
- **Realistic goals** based on feasibility, not aspiration  
- **Massive, sustained investment** in capability building
- **Regional cooperation** to collectively reduce dependence
- **Acceptance** that some dependency is inevitable

Most importantly, India's experience demonstrates that **attempted derisking can backfire** if not carefully designed and implemented. Other countries contemplating similar strategies should learn from these mistakes rather than repeat them.

The question is not whether to derisk from China—geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities make this imperative—but **how** to do so effectively. Our analysis suggests that current approaches are insufficient and that fundamental rethinking is required.

Future policy must be grounded in economic realities, implemented with comprehensive ecosystem support, and pursued with realistic timelines. Only then can derisking succeed where India's initiative has, thus far, failed.
