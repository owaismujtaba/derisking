## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 The Digital Paradox: Modernization vs. Autonomy
Our findings reveal a fundamental tension in India's development strategy: the conflict between **rapid digitization** and **strategic autonomy**.
- **Digitization Goals**: India aims for a $1 Trillion Digital Economy, driving mass adoption of 4G/5G, smartphones, and cloud computing.
- **Autonomy Goals**: India aims to reduce reliance on Chinese hardware.

**The Conflict**: The digitization timeline (3-5 years) is far shorter than the hardware indigenization timeline (10-15 years). By accelerating digitization *before* establishing a hardware base, India inadvertently supercharged its demand for Chinese inputs. Every new 5G subscriber or smartphone user increases the aggregate TDI, as the domestic ecosystem cannot yet supply the underlying components.

### 5.2 The "Screwdriver Effect" in Policy Design
The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for electronics prioritized **Final Assembly** (SKD/CKD) over component manufacturing.
- **Outcome**: India successfully replaced imported *finished phones* with domestic assembly.
- **Consequence**: This transformed the trade basket from "Consumer Goods" to "Intermediate Goods" (kits, screens, chips). Since Chinese component ecosystems are deeply integrated, dependency simply shifted upstream.
- **Data**: HS 85 (Electrical Machinery) imports grew 25%, but the composition shifted towards parts and sub-assemblies.

### 5.3 Comparative Advantage in "Old Economy"
The success in **Iron & Steel** (HS 72) and **Chemicals** (before exclusion) validates the "infant industry" argument where technology is mature. Indian firms like Tata Steel and Reliance Industries leveraged scale and local raw materials to displace Chinese imports. This proves that *Atmanirbhar Bharat* is not conceptually flawed, but technologically constrained. It works where India has "Technology Adjacency."

## 6. Policy Implications

### 6.1 Correcting the "Tech Deficit"
India must acknowledge that it cannot "leapfrog" manufacturing stages.
1.  **Component-Centric PLI**: Shift incentives from assembly (low value-add) to critical components (PCBs, displays, batteries).
2.  **Strategic Partnerships**: Accept that indigenous semiconductor capability is decades away. Formalize "Friendshoring" pacts with Taiwan (TSMC) and the US (Intel) to secure non-Chinese supply chains for the interim 10-year gap.

### 6.2 Managing the Transition
1.  **Stockpiles**: Create strategic reserves for critical *components*, not just critical minerals.
2.  **Diversification**: Enforce "China + 1" mandates for PLI beneficiaries. If a company receives subsidies, it must demonstrate a roadmap to source <50% of its BOM from a single country.

## 7. Conclusion

This study disentangled the COVID-19 shock from structural trade trends to evaluate India's ambitious derisking initiative.
**Contrary to the "COVID Alibi,"** we find that the pandemic explains only a small portion (**14%**) of the increased dependency (+0.92 pp). The overwhelmingly dominant driver (**86%**, or +5.47 pp) is a structural acceleration in India's integration with the Chinese technology ecosystem.

We identify a **"Dual-Speed" outcome**:
1.  **Success in Industry**: Traditional sectors (Steel, Basic Chemicals) successfully derisked.
2.  **Deepening in Tech**: The digitizing economy's hunger for hardware overwhelmed policy barriers.

**Final Verdict**: India's derisking is not a failure of intent, but a victim of the **"Digital Paradox"** (**Figure 6**). Modernization has fueled dependency faster than industrial policy could build autonomy. The path forward requires a realistic recalibration: accepting structural interdependence in high-tech for the medium term, while aggressively building the component ecosystem for the long term.
