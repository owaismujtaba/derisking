# Theoretical Framework for India's Derisking Analysis

## 1.3 Theoretical Framework

### 1.3.1 Asymmetric Interdependence and Vulnerability

Our analysis is grounded in the theory of **asymmetric interdependence** (Hirschman 1945; Keohane & Nye 1977), which posits that economic relationships create both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Hirschman's seminal work demonstrated that trade dependence can be weaponized - the more dependent country A is on country B, the greater B's potential leverage over A's foreign policy choices.

Keohane and Nye (1977) refined this framework by distinguishing between:
- **Sensitivity interdependence**: The speed and magnitude of effects transmitted across borders
- **Vulnerability interdependence**: The costs of adjusting to changes in the relationship

India's derisking initiative explicitly targets **vulnerability interdependence** - reducing the costs that would arise if China were to restrict exports or manipulate trade flows for political purposes.

### 1.3.2 Weaponized Interdependence

Recent scholarship on **weaponized interdependence** (Farrell & Newman 2019; Drezner 2021) demonstrates that states increasingly use economic networks as instruments of coercion. China's rare earth export restrictions (2010), pharmaceutical API leverage during COVID-19, and semiconductor supply chain control exemplify this phenomenon.

Farrell and Newman identify two mechanisms through which network position translates to power:
1. **Panopticon effect**: Visibility into network flows enables surveillance and information gathering
2. **Chokepoint effect**: Control over critical nodes enables denial and disruption

India's derisking strategy aims to reduce China's chokepoint power by:
- Diversifying import sources (reducing concentration)
- Developing domestic production (reducing dependence)
- Building strategic reserves (reducing vulnerability)

### 1.3.3 Economic Statecraft and Policy Effectiveness

Baldwin's (1985) framework on economic statecraft provides the lens for evaluating policy effectiveness. He argues that economic instruments (trade restrictions, subsidies, diversification) are tools of foreign policy, and their success depends on:
- **Clarity of objectives**: Are goals well-defined?
- **Instrument-target matching**: Do policies address root causes?
- **Implementation capacity**: Can the state execute effectively?

Drezner (2021) adds that economic coercion often fails because:
- **Domestic political constraints** limit policy options
- **Market forces** counteract government interventions
- **Target adaptation** reduces policy effectiveness over time

### 1.3.4 Hypotheses

Drawing from this theoretical foundation, we derive five testable hypotheses:

**H1 (Trade Dependency)**: Derisking policies reduce import dependency on China.
- **Operationalization**: TDI_China decreases from baseline to intervention period
- **Mechanism**: Tariffs, import restrictions, and alternative sourcing reduce China's share

**H2 (Diversification)**: Policy intervention increases trade partner diversity.
- **Operationalization**: HHI decreases (lower concentration)
- **Mechanism**: Incentives for alternative partners reduce concentration risk

**H3 (Substitution)**: Alternative partners compensate for reduced China imports.
- **Operationalization**: CPODS > 1 (alternatives gain more than China loses)
- **Mechanism**: China-Plus-One strategy shifts sourcing to ASEAN, USA, EU

**H4 (Domestic Production)**: Manufacturing policies reduce import dependence.
- **Operationalization**: DMSI increases in targeted sectors
- **Mechanism**: PLI schemes and Make in India boost domestic production

**H5 (Strategic Sectors)**: Critical sectors show greater derisking progress.
- **Operationalization**: SSVI decreases more in high-criticality sectors
- **Mechanism**: Targeted interventions prioritize strategic industries

### 1.3.5 Theoretical Expectations vs. Empirical Reality

**Theory predicts**: If derisking policies are effective, we should observe:
- ↓ TDI (H1)
- ↓ HHI (H2)
- CPODS > 1 (H3)
- ↑ DMSI (H4)
- ↓ SSVI in critical sectors (H5)

**Our findings show**:
- ↑ TDI (H1 **REJECTED**)
- ↑ HHI (H2 **REJECTED**)
- CPODS < 1 (H3 **REJECTED**)
- Mixed DMSI (H4 **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**)
- Mixed SSVI (H5 **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**)

This **systematic failure** of theoretical predictions raises critical questions:
1. Why did derisking policies **increase** rather than decrease dependency?
2. What market forces or structural factors overwhelmed policy interventions?
3. Are current policy instruments fundamentally mismatched to objectives?

### 1.3.6 Theoretical Contributions

Our findings contribute to three literatures:

**1. Asymmetric Interdependence**: We demonstrate that **attempted** derisking can paradoxically **increase** vulnerability if:
- Policies trigger defensive responses (China doubles down on exports)
- Market forces overwhelm government interventions
- Implementation lags create transition vulnerabilities

**2. Economic Statecraft**: We provide evidence that economic policy instruments may be **ineffective** when:
- Target country (China) has structural advantages (scale, cost)
- Domestic industry lacks capacity to substitute
- Global value chains are deeply entrenched

**3. Policy Evaluation**: We show the importance of **rigorous measurement** - without quantitative assessment, policymakers may persist with failing strategies based on anecdotal evidence.
